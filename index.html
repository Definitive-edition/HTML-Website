<h1>What is this fire emblem and why do people talk about it so much </h1>

<h2>Fire emblem is a strategy RPG series that has had many successful entries over the past
few years. It was a series that was once on the verge of death but then one game by the name of Fire Emblem Awakening saved the franchise.

</h2>

<h2>There are many ways to approach every chapter/map and is at it's best when
    you have to balance side objectives with main objectives and even personal objectives
you set for yourself. </h2>

<h2>
 The series has many great starting points that are beginner-friendly to new players
 Which is what I will talk about on the next page!

</ul>

<h1> 
    Starting point reccomendations: Geneaology Of the Holy War, Path Of Radiance, Blazing Blade, Sacred Stones, Shadow Dragon, Awakening, Birthright, Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, Three Houses and Engage.
</h1>

<h2> These entries have a good balance of story, gameplay, accessibility and dialouge except for engage.</h2>


<h2> Three Houses deviates from the series formula quite a bit but is still generally beginner-friendly. When this game first released, it was more leisurely in terms of difficulty but then later recieved Maddening Mode which is seen as the series' best challenge.</h2>

<h2> Geneaology of the Holy War has the biggest maps which require you to seize multiple keeps and has 12 chapters. This game is where the story excels even if it's at the cost of map design and variety of objectives</h2>



<h2>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia really prioritizes the story alot but doesn't have the best gameplay elements.
Your mileage will vary on the gameplay but if you want a good story. This is the game for you.</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem: Blazing Blade is the first game released in The West and drew in alot of fans.</h2>

<h2>Path of Radiance is the first game to have 3d graphics and 3d characters and has Maniac Mode for the Japanese Version which was removed from International Releases bc of it's poor reception from Japanese Players. 
    It has 4 difficulties in total, easy, normal, hard and maniac.
</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones is targeted towards beginners alot more than you might think
    it features two routes, one of which centers around the kind but naive Erikia and the second which centers around
    her confident but reckless twin brother Ephraim and is also more challenging.
</h2>

<h2>Shadow Dragon is a remake of the very first fire emblem that started us fans all on this wild ride. 
    This game is a reimagining of the war of shadows. It also has the weapon triangle which the first 
    game didn't have at all as well as forging weapons and free reclassing. It also has difficulties for everyone in the fanbase.
</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem Awakening is a beginner friendly game that revived the series because they put everything that they could think of
    such as pair ups, forging, overworld battles and more. It even has this really difficult dlc map called Apotheosis which is for Hardcore Players.
</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright features the easiest gameplay of the entire franchise
    and as with all three fates games includes a dragon vein mechanic that does a whole lot of stuff such as
    creating healing tiles, striking enemies in a certain place and even more.
</h2>


<h2>Engage has inansely good gameplay with a mechanic that lets you pull off insane plays and introduces alot of characters from across the series who are mostly main characters of their respective games.</h2>

<h1>Games not to start/worth getting to eventually: Thracia 776, Binding Blade, Radiant Dawn, Conquest, Revelation, New Mystery of the Emblem</h1>

<h2>These games are either sequels or otherwise more challenging and not very beginner-friendly
    
</h2>

<h2> Thracia 776 has Paragon Mode if you really can't resist which is an easier difficulty that doubles the experience 
    you get from killing enemies It's the first game to have a variety of other objectives such as defend and escape. 
</h2>

<h2>Binding Blade is the most challenging of the GBA games bc of the unbalanced growth rates of units and
    the fact that the game has the weakest lord in the entire franchise. He promotes very late into the game as well. This game also differs from the series quite a bit
in that it includes 2 different endings. </h2>

<h2>You need to meet certain requirements to unlock the Gaiden Chapters and complete those gaiden chapters. These requirements can include keeping a certain player alive,
    finishing a map in under a certain amount of turns. 
</h2>
<h2>New Mystery of the Emblem is a sequel to Shadow Dragon and features more complex map design and has Lunatic-Reverse Mode which is an unlockable difficulty that makes it so that enemies always attack first even on player phase unless you have a range advantage over them.
    This may not be the hardest game but this entry pushed the series into extreme heights.  </h2>

<h2>Radiant Dawn is seen as one of the more difficult entries since the Dawn Brigade
  is underleveled making the game difficult. If you ever play hard mode, the battle save feature is disabled and
enemy attack ranges can't be seen forcing you to manually count out enemy movement spaces. </h2>

<h2> Conquest is one of the most challenging games in the Fates Trilogy because it is 
    reminiscent of the classic fire emblems with limited resources such as gold and exp (unless of course, you have the dlc). It also has the best maps among the 3ds entries and is the first
    entry since radiant dawn to features objectives other than seize, kill boss, and rout.
</h2>

<h2>Revelation is the sequel to both birthright and conquest and brings together both characters from birthright and conquest.
    This game also has unique map design. It has recieved very critical feedback bc people claim that the maps are boring or downright infuriating.

<h1>The first two Fire Emblem games</h1>

<h2>Fire Emblem 1: Shadow Dragon and The Blade of Light: The very first fire emblem released in 1990.
    The story is centered around Marth who is the hero-king of Altea in the continent of Archanea on a quest to reclaim his throne
after being forced into exile by the 2 main villains of the game who is the Shadow Dragon Medeus and his right hand partner in crime, Gharnef.
This game is easily one of the most dated games and for very valid reason, this is an NES game through and through and NES games aren't known for stellar UIs and your mileage on this game 
will vary greatly depending on your patience.    </h2>


<h2>Fire Emblem 2: Gaiden which is the last game on the Famicom is known for it's largely unique mechanics that were unique to this game and was mostly abandoned by most other games in the series.
    The game takes place on the Continent of Valentia which is west of Archanea which was split in two through the infuence of the two gods named Mila and the main villain Duma. This game follows 2 characters, one of which is Alm, a young leader who leads an army called the deliverance who is looking to take back Zofia castle from Daisax's army who is Alm's sworn enemy.
 The other which is a priestess named Celica who is Alm's childhood best friend who looks to find the missing goddess Mila and solve the mystery of a famine sweeping across all of zofia. </h2>

<h1>All fire emblem games on the SNES</h1>


    <h2>Fire Emblem 3: Mystery of the Emblem is divided into 2 routes. On one hand, it follows the same story as the war of shadows which is fire emblem 1 and on the other hand,
        it's a proper sequel that takes place 2 years after the War of Shadows which is about the more mysterious side of archanea and the origin of it's respective sacred relics. 
    </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem 4: Geneaology of the Holy War is one of the most unique games that introduced mechanics that would become series staples such as the weapon triangle This game also introduces the love system which is where characters fall in love depending on the player's actions. The game is split into 
        two halves with part 1 centering around Sigurd and part 2 around his son seliph.
    </h2>

    <h2>
Fire Emblem 5: Thracia 776 is a midquel to Geneaology and centers around Leif who is seliph's cousin. Just like Marth, Leif was forced into exile as a child and his goal is to reclaim his birthright.
This game includes alot of unique mechanics such as thracia fog, movement stars, the ability to even level up your movement, Unit fatigue, capturing enemies and more. This game also
was the first game to have more variety in terms of objectives such as defending a certain area for a certain amount of turns and escape objectives.

    <h1>All fire emblem games on the GBA</h1>


    <h2>Fire Emblem 6: The Binding Blade takes place on the continent of Elibe and serves as a sequel to fire emblem 7 and takes place 20 years later where Zephiel is the big bad of this game. Although this is a much simpler game due to the fact that this game has 2 objectives
        which are seize and kill boss as well as things like movement stars, unit fatigue this is the toughest of the GBA games because of the combination of unit balance and strong enemy armies. You even need to fulfill specific 
        conditions in order to unlock Gaiden chapters in order to then get the true ending. 
     </h2>

<h2>Fire emblem 7: The Blazing Blade is the first game released in the west and serves as a prequel to Binding Blade. This game centers around Lyn who survived a massacre of the bandits of Taliver. A year later, she joined Eliwood and Hector to investigate
    the Black Fang and the Activities of Nergal. This game is divided into tales, one of which is Lyn's tale which is 11 chapters and 
    serves as a tutorial for the game, A year later Eliwood's tale which is the main part of the game takes place and then after completing that, there's Hector's tale which offers much higher challenge.
    This game is aimed at both newcomers and hardcore fans. 

</h2>

<h2>
The final entry on the GBA, Fire Emblem 8: The Sacred Stones centers around the kind but naive erikia and her confident but reckless twin brother Ephraim.
This game takes place on the Continent of Magvel. Their neighboring kingdom of Grado mysteriously turns on them and this game
focuses on how they turned traitor to the rest of Magvel. This game features two routes, one that follows erikia's army and another that follows ephraim's army which is a more difficult route.
This game is aimed more for beginners and is seen as one of the easier games in the franchise.

<h1>Wii/GCN games</h1>

<h2>Fire emblem 9: Path of Radiance is the first and only game on the GameCube. This game features 3d graphics and has maniac mode which is the highest difficulty which has been removed from 
    the international releases because of poor reception. This game takes place on the continent of tellius which is inhabited by not only the human race but also the laguz. The game starts with Greil and the main
    character ike to fight his band of mercenaries. This is one of the very few games that has a little music jingle for when the player phase and enemy phase starts. This game can also drag at times
    because enemy phases can drag on for a long time because of expanded enemy armies. There are also chapters where you can control what units do who are not recruited in your army. The final 
    chapter has a second phase on the harder difficulties. This game also includes a base where you can give bonus exp to certain units and pair units up to increase support level. My only gripe with this game is that
    if you remove a skill from your unit, it's lost forever.  

</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem 10: Radiant Dawn is the direct sequel to path of radiance taking place 3 years after path of radiance. This game unlike most others have 4 parts all shifting between perspectives and factions of tellius. 
    This is one of the hardest games in the series because the dawn brigade is severely outclassed by the enemy army. As for the gameplay, it retains most of the mechanics from Radiant Dawn and is one of the only titles 
that have redistributable skills so if you remove a skill from one character, it doesn't completely get rid of the skill and you can give the skill to whoever you see fit. This is also one of the games
that have more objective variety. If you play hard mode, the weapon triangle isn't in effect and you can't see the enemy movement ranges without manually counting them out yourself.</h2>

    </ul>

<h1>DS Games</h1>

<h2>Fire Emblem 11: Shadow Dragon is the last remake we got from fire emblem 1. It's fully translated and even includes so much more things than it's predecessors such as the weapon triangle
    which didn't exist in the first fire emblem and also free reclassing. This game also differs from most other titles and includes several modes under the banner of hard mode. With H5 being the hardest mode in the entire
    series. Each version gives enemies higher stats and higher level weapons such as Bolganone and Silver Swords much earlier in the game. This game has difficulties for the entire fanbase 
</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem 12: New Mystery of the Emblem is a remake of mystery of the emblem and retains most of the mechanics from shadow dragon and even includes base conversations that increases the support rank of characters and give units boons during battle. Unfortunately there 
    there is still no official english release of this game. This game is also the first game to introduce casual mode which makes it so that units return the next chapter if dead. This is also the 
first game to have a playable avatar. While the idea of a playable avatar is fine on paper since it's from games like elden ring to pokemon, it's awkward because in essence, the game adds in a character to a story that never really existed.
On the flip-side of things, it promotes a lot of replayability as you can customize your avatar as you see fit. This game also includes Lunatic-reverse mode as the highest difficulty because enemies always strike first
which completely changes the way you approach the game entirely.
    </h2>




<h1>3DS games</h1>


<h2>Fire Emblem 13: Awakening is the first 3ds game and the one that revived the entire franchise because the developers put everything that they could think of into this game. They 
    bought back elements from Geneaology of the Holy War while also implementing brand new features such as pair ups. This game takes place in the same universe of shadow dragon but many years later
    and characters like marth and alm has faded into legend. It starts with robin meeting a mysterious character named chrom and then building an army and destroying the fell dragon grima. 
    It even has dlc where you can infinitely grind for exp and gold.
</h2>

<h1>DISCLAIMER: Fire Emblem Fates is broken up into 3 games where Conflicts arise between Nohr and Hoshido and these entries not only cater to certain kinds of players, it also reflects 
    the choice that the player makes, to side with the kingdom he was born into or the kingdom that raised Corrin. A new feature called "My Castle" was implemented into the trilogy 
    to create a base for your army where you can establish shops to buy weapons and items and interact with your allies and those shops can be leveled up which allows the character to choose a wider
    range of weapons and items. It costs DVP or Dragon Vein Points which you get from completing battles. 
</h1>
<h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is one of the easiest games and where Corrin sides with Hoshido. It features one of the easiest maps of the series with unlimited opportunity to earn
    resources like gold, equipment and exp and Objectives are not as diverse. </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest is one of the harder games in the series where objectives are far more diverse, such as defending an area, escaping and more. Resources like EXP and gold are more
        limited. Corrin sides with Nohr in this game. Late into the game on Lunatic Mode, enemies will have 2 very dangerous enemy-exclusive skills which are Inevitable end and Staff Savant.
        The only other way to grind for exp, gold and DVP is with the DLC. 
    </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation is where Corrin Refuses to side with either Hoshido or Nohr and instead venture into the Invisible Kingdom known as Valla. 
        Throughout the other entries, it becomes clear that unseen forces are at work. This entry allows you to recruit allies from both kingdoms and it's harder than birthright but easier than conquest.
        Certain chapters might have harder conditions to meet but the objectives remain simple and you also have unlimited skirmishes to grind for money and EXP.
    </h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia is a complete reimagining of gaiden with full on cutscenes and voice acting with so much cinematic flare 
    that really brings the game to life. The gameplay is still good but the only stupid mechanic is that special attacks cost you your own HP. The gameplay and map design isn't the best and the game excels more at it's story.


</h2>



<h1>Switch Games</h1>


<h2>Fire Emblem 16: Three Houses was the first switch game which was one of the more leisurely games in the series but then at somepoint, 
    a certain update gae us exactly what we needed, Maddening Mode which effectively made the game much more challenging and gave the game what it needed most.
This game deviates from the series formula quite a bit due to the fact that unlike other games, the game operates on a calendar and there is a great deal of unit 
customization that comes into play and you can build your army as you see fit. There are also muliple class paths and multiple times where you have opportunities to promote and reclass. 
This game is pretty ambitious because of it's willingness to have a whole school-like mechanic in the game, but it's almost too ambitious because of the amount of 
reused content, this game includes 4 routes and three houses that give you access to certain units earlier than others. Recruitment also works alot differently than most other games in the
series. Your main character Byleth has to have a C rank proficiency in certain skills such as sword, lance etc or the better method would be to
increase your support level with them to B and then at some point during the week phase, that character will ask byleth to join their house/army.   As you play through the game, it becomes much clearer that 
this game either needed more development time or needed to be scaled back to 1 or two routes. Even Fates utilized having multiple routes 
so much better.   </h2>


<h2>Fire Emblem 17: Engage is the latest Fire Emblem with not the best story but probably the best gameplay i've seen thus far. This game is a celebration of everything that is fire emblem, 
    This game has levels, soundtracks and characters from all over the series such as Marth, Ike, Micaiah, and more. This game has all the main chaacters from all over the series as emblems
which give various buffs to your allies and even includes signature moves that you could use on your enemies to do a whole bunch of stuff to them. The weapon triangle is back but this time around, 
if you attack someone whose weapon is weak to another weapon you inflict "Break" which is a status effect that prevents you from making a follow up attack. The game also allows you to actually run around and explore not just in the Somniel which is the home base between chapters 
but also after chapters to collect stuff and talk to allies.  </h2>
