    <h1> 
        Starting point reccomendations: Geneaology Of the Holy War, Path Of Radiance, Blazing Blade, Sacred Stones, Shadow Dragon, Awakening, Birthright, Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, Three Houses and Engage.
    </h1>
    
    <h2> These entries have a good balance of story, gameplay, accessibility and dialouge except for engage.</h2>
    
    
    <h2> Three Houses deviates from the series formula quite a bit but is still generally beginner-friendly. When this game first released, it was more leisurely in terms of difficulty but then later recieved Maddening Mode which is seen as the series' best challenge.</h2>
    
    <h2> Geneaology of the Holy War has the biggest maps which require you to seize multiple keeps and has 12 chapters. This game is where the story excels even if it's at the cost of map design and variety of objectives</h2>
    
    
    
    <h2>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia really prioritizes the story alot but doesn't have the best gameplay elements.
    Your mileage will vary on the gameplay but if you want a good story. This is the game for you.</h2>
    
    <h2>Fire Emblem: Blazing Blade is the first game released in The West and drew in alot of fans.</h2>
    
    <h2>Path of Radiance is the first game to have 3d graphics and 3d characters and has Maniac Mode for the Japanese Version which was removed from International Releases bc of it's poor reception from Japanese Players. 
        It has 4 difficulties in total, easy, normal, hard and maniac.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones is targeted towards beginners alot more than you might think
        it features two routes, one of which centers around the kind but naive Erikia and the second which centers around
        her confident but reckless twin brother Ephraim and is also more challenging.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Shadow Dragon is a remake of the very first fire emblem that started us fans all on this wild ride. 
        This game is a reimagining of the war of shadows. It also has the weapon triangle which the first 
        game didn't have at all as well as forging weapons and free reclassing. It also has difficulties for everyone in the fanbase.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Fire Emblem Awakening is a beginner friendly game that revived the series because they put everything that they could think of
        such as pair ups, forging, overworld battles and more. It even has this really difficult dlc map called Apotheosis which is for Hardcore Players.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright features the easiest gameplay of the entire franchise
        and as with all three fates games includes a dragon vein mechanic that does a whole lot of stuff such as
        creating healing tiles, striking enemies in a certain place and even more.
    </h2>
    
    
    <h2>Engage has inansely good gameplay with a mechanic that lets you pull off insane plays and introduces alot of characters from across the series who are mostly main characters of their respective games.</h2>
    
    <h1>Games not to start/worth getting to eventually: Thracia 776, Binding Blade, Radiant Dawn, Conquest, Revelation, New Mystery of the Emblem</h1>
    
    <h2>These games are either sequels or otherwise more challenging and not very beginner-friendly
        
    </h2>
    
    <h2> Thracia 776 has Paragon Mode if you really can't resist which is an easier difficulty that doubles the experience 
        you get from killing enemies It's the first game to have a variety of other objectives such as defend and escape. 
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Binding Blade is the most challenging of the GBA games bc of the unbalanced growth rates of units and
        the fact that the game has the weakest lord in the entire franchise. He promotes very late into the game as well. This game also differs from the series quite a bit
    in that it includes 2 different endings. </h2>
    
    <h2>You need to meet certain requirements to unlock the Gaiden Chapters and complete those gaiden chapters. These requirements can include keeping a certain player alive,
        finishing a map in under a certain amount of turns. 
    </h2>
    <h2>New Mystery of the Emblem is a sequel to Shadow Dragon and features more complex map design and has Lunatic-Reverse Mode which is an unlockable difficulty that makes it so that enemies always attack first even on player phase unless you have a range advantage over them.
        This may not be the hardest game but this entry pushed the series into extreme heights.  </h2>
    
    <h2>Radiant Dawn is seen as one of the more difficult entries since the Dawn Brigade
      is underleveled making the game difficult. If you ever play hard mode, the battle save feature is disabled and
    enemy attack ranges can't be seen forcing you to manually count out enemy movement spaces. </h2>
    
    <h2> Conquest is one of the most challenging games in the Fates Trilogy because it is 
        reminiscent of the classic fire emblems with limited resources such as gold and exp (unless of course, you have the dlc). It also has the best maps among the 3ds entries and is the first
        entry since radiant dawn to features objectives other than seize, kill boss, and rout.
    </h2>
    
    <h2>Revelation is the sequel to both birthright and conquest and brings together both characters from birthright and conquest.
        This game also has unique map design. It has recieved very critical feedback bc people claim that the maps are boring or downright infuriating.
