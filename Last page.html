<h1>Wii/GCN games</h1>

<h2>Fire emblem 9: Path of Radiance is the first and only game on the GameCube. This game features 3d graphics and has maniac mode which is the highest difficulty which has been removed from 
    the international releases because of poor reception. This game takes place on the continent of tellius which is inhabited by not only the human race but also the laguz. The game starts with Greil and the main
    character ike to fight his band of mercenaries. This is one of the very few games that has a little music jingle for when the player phase and enemy phase starts. This game can also drag at times
    because enemy phases can drag on for a long time because of expanded enemy armies. There are also chapters where you can control what units do who are not recruited in your army. The final 
    chapter has a second phase on the harder difficulties. This game also includes a base where you can give bonus exp to certain units and pair units up to increase support level. My only gripe with this game is that
    if you remove a skill from your unit, it's lost forever.  

</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem 10: Radiant Dawn is the direct sequel to path of radiance taking place 3 years after path of radiance. This game unlike most others have 4 parts all shifting between perspectives and factions of tellius. 
    This is one of the hardest games in the series because the dawn brigade is severely outclassed by the enemy army. As for the gameplay, it retains most of the mechanics from Radiant Dawn and is one of the only titles 
that have redistributable skills so if you remove a skill from one character, it doesn't completely get rid of the skill and you can give the skill to whoever you see fit. This is also one of the games
that have more objective variety. If you play hard mode, the weapon triangle isn't in effect and you can't see the enemy movement ranges without manually counting them out yourself.</h2>


<h1>DS Games</h1>

<h2>Fire Emblem 11: Shadow Dragon is the last remake we got from fire emblem 1. It's fully translated and even includes so much more things than it's predecessors such as the weapon triangle
    which didn't exist in the first fire emblem and also free reclassing. This game also differs from most other titles and includes several modes under the banner of hard mode. With H5 being the hardest mode in the entire
    series. Each version gives enemies higher stats and higher level weapons such as Bolganone and Silver Swords much earlier in the game. This game has difficulties for the entire fanbase 
</h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem 12: New Mystery of the Emblem is a remake of mystery of the emblem and retains most of the mechanics from shadow dragon and even includes base conversations that increases the support rank of characters and give units boons during battle. Unfortunately there 
    there is still no official english release of this game. This game is also the first game to introduce casual mode which makes it so that units return the next chapter if dead. This is also the 
first game to have a playable avatar. While the idea of a playable avatar is fine on paper since it's from games like elden ring to pokemon, it's awkward because in essence, the game adds in a character to a story that never really existed.
On the flip-side of things, it promotes a lot of replayability as you can customize your avatar as you see fit. This game also includes Lunatic-reverse mode as the highest difficulty because enemies always strike first
which completely changes the way you approach the game entirely.
    </h2>




<h1>3DS games</h1>


<h2>Fire Emblem 13: Awakening is the first 3ds game and the one that revived the entire franchise because the developers put everything that they could think of into this game. They 
    bought back elements from Geneaology of the Holy War while also implementing brand new features such as pair ups. This game takes place in the same universe of shadow dragon but many years later
    and characters like marth and alm has faded into legend. It starts with robin meeting a mysterious character named chrom and then building an army and destroying the fell dragon grima. 
    It even has dlc where you can infinitely grind for exp and gold.
</h2>

<h1>DISCLAIMER: Fire Emblem Fates is broken up into 3 games where Conflicts arise between Nohr and Hoshido and these entries not only cater to certain kinds of players, it also reflects 
    the choice that the player makes, to side with the kingdom he was born into or the kingdom that raised Corrin. A new feature called "My Castle" was implemented into the trilogy 
    to create a base for your army where you can establish shops to buy weapons and items and interact with your allies and those shops can be leveled up which allows the character to choose a wider
    range of weapons and items. It costs DVP or Dragon Vein Points which you get from completing battles. 
</h1>
<h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is one of the easiest games and where Corrin sides with Hoshido. It features one of the easiest maps of the series with unlimited opportunity to earn
    resources like gold, equipment and exp and Objectives are not as diverse. </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest is one of the harder games in the series where objectives are far more diverse, such as defending an area, escaping and more. Resources like EXP and gold are more
        limited. Corrin sides with Nohr in this game. Late into the game on Lunatic Mode, enemies will have 2 very dangerous enemy-exclusive skills which are Inevitable end and Staff Savant.
        The only other way to grind for exp, gold and DVP is with the DLC. 
    </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation is where Corrin Refuses to side with either Hoshido or Nohr and instead venture into the Invisible Kingdom known as Valla. 
        Throughout the other entries, it becomes clear that unseen forces are at work. This entry allows you to recruit allies from both kingdoms and it's harder than birthright but easier than conquest.
        Certain chapters might have harder conditions to meet but the objectives remain simple and you also have unlimited skirmishes to grind for money and EXP.
    </h2>

<h2>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia is a complete reimagining of gaiden with full on cutscenes and voice acting with so much cinematic flare 
    that really brings the game to life. The gameplay is still good but the only stupid mechanic is that special attacks cost you your own HP. The gameplay and map design isn't the best and the game excels more at it's story.


</h2>



<h1>Switch Games</h1>


<h2>Fire Emblem 16: Three Houses was the first switch game which was one of the more leisurely games in the series but then at somepoint, 
    a certain update gae us exactly what we needed, Maddening Mode which effectively made the game much more challenging and gave the game what it needed most.
This game deviates from the series formula quite a bit due to the fact that unlike other games, the game operates on a calendar and there is a great deal of unit 
customization that comes into play and you can build your army as you see fit. There are also muliple class paths and multiple times where you have opportunities to promote and reclass. 
This game is pretty ambitious because of it's willingness to have a whole school-like mechanic in the game, but it's almost too ambitious because of the amount of 
reused content, this game includes 4 routes and three houses that give you access to certain units earlier than others. Recruitment also works alot differently than most other games in the
series. Your main character Byleth has to have a C rank proficiency in certain skills such as sword, lance etc or the better method would be to
increase your support level with them to B and then at some point during the week phase, that character will ask byleth to join their house/army.   As you play through the game, it becomes much clearer that 
this game either needed more development time or needed to be scaled back to 1 or two routes. Even Fates utilized having multiple routes 
so much better.   </h2>


<h2>Fire Emblem 17: Engage is the latest Fire Emblem with not the best story but probably the best gameplay i've seen thus far. This game is a celebration of everything that is fire emblem, 
    This game has levels, soundtracks and characters from all over the series such as Marth, Ike, Micaiah, and more. This game has all the main chaacters from all over the series as emblems
which give various buffs to your allies and even includes signature moves that you could use on your enemies to do a whole bunch of stuff to them. The weapon triangle is back but this time around, 
if you attack someone whose weapon is weak to another weapon you inflict "Break" which is a status effect that prevents you from making a follow up attack. The game also allows you to actually run around and explore not just in the Somniel which is the home base between chapters 
but also after chapters to collect stuff and talk to allies.  </h2>
