<h1>The first two Fire Emblem games</h1>

<h2>Fire Emblem 1: Shadow Dragon and The Blade of Light: The very first fire emblem released in 1990.
    The story is centered around Marth who is the hero-king of Altea in the continent of Archanea on a quest to reclaim his throne
after being forced into exile by the 2 main villains of the game who is the Shadow Dragon Medeus and his right hand partner in crime, Gharnef.
This game is easily one of the most dated games and for very valid reason, this is an NES game through and through and NES games aren't known for stellar UIs and your mileage on this game 
will vary greatly depending on your patience.    </h2>


<h2>Fire Emblem 2: Gaiden which is the last game on the Famicom is known for it's largely unique mechanics that were unique to this game and was mostly abandoned by most other games in the series.
    The game takes place on the Continent of Valentia which is west of Archanea which was split in two through the infuence of the two gods named Mila and the main villain Duma. This game follows 2 characters, one of which is Alm, a young leader who leads an army called the deliverance who is looking to take back Zofia castle from Daisax's army who is Alm's sworn enemy.
 The other which is a priestess named Celica who is Alm's childhood best friend who looks to find the missing goddess Mila and solve the mystery of a famine sweeping across all of zofia. </h2>





<h1>All fire emblem games on the SNES</h1>


    <h2>Fire Emblem 3: Mystery of the Emblem is divided into 2 routes. On one hand, it follows the same story as the war of shadows which is fire emblem 1 and on the other hand,
        it's a proper sequel that takes place 2 years after the War of Shadows which is about the more mysterious side of archanea and the origin of it's respective sacred relics. 
    </h2>

    <h2>Fire Emblem 4: Geneaology of the Holy War is one of the most unique games that introduced mechanics that would become series staples such as the weapon triangle This game also introduces the love system which is where characters fall in love depending on the player's actions. The game is split into 
        two halves with part 1 centering around Sigurd and part 2 around his son seliph.
    </h2>

    <h2>
Fire Emblem 5: Thracia 776 is a midquel to Geneaology and centers around Leif who is seliph's cousin. Just like Marth, Leif was forced into exile as a child and his goal is to reclaim his birthright.
This game includes alot of unique mechanics such as thracia fog, movement stars, the ability to even level up your movement, Unit fatigue, capturing enemies and more. This game also
was the first game to have more variety in terms of objectives such as defending a certain area for a certain amount of turns and escape objectives.

    <h1>All fire emblem games on the GBA</h1>


    <h2>Fire Emblem 6: The Binding Blade takes place on the continent of Elibe and serves as a sequel to fire emblem 7 and takes place 20 years later where Zephiel is the big bad of this game. Although this is a much simpler game due to the fact that this game has 2 objectives
        which are seize and kill boss as well as things like movement stars, unit fatigue this is the toughest of the GBA games because of the combination of unit balance and strong enemy armies. You even need to fulfill specific 
        conditions in order to unlock Gaiden chapters in order to then get the true ending. 
     </h2>

<h2>Fire emblem 7: The Blazing Blade is the first game released in the west and serves as a prequel to Binding Blade. This game centers around Lyn who survived a massacre of the bandits of Taliver. A year later, she joined Eliwood and Hector to investigate
    the Black Fang and the Activities of Nergal. This game is divided into tales, one of which is Lyn's tale which is 11 chapters and 
    serves as a tutorial for the game, A year later Eliwood's tale which is the main part of the game takes place and then after completing that, there's Hector's tale which offers much higher challenge.
    This game is aimed at both newcomers and hardcore fans. 

</h2>

<h2>
The final entry on the GBA, Fire Emblem 8: The Sacred Stones centers around the kind but naive erikia and her confident but reckless twin brother Ephraim.
This game takes place on the Continent of Magvel. Their neighboring kingdom of Grado mysteriously turns on them and this game
focuses on how they turned traitor to the rest of Magvel. This game features two routes, one that follows erikia's army and another that follows ephraim's army which is a more difficult route.
This game is aimed more for beginners and is seen as one of the easier games in the franchise.
